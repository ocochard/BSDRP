# This is a simple configuration file for freevrrpd
# Please read the documentation before modifying these parameters
# I recommend to not set addr to the unique and real ip of your server because
# if freevrrpd will shutdown, your server will don't have any IP address.
# a good utilization is to set a real IP address not managed by freevrrpd and
# then choosing an alias for the virtual IP address managed by freevrrpd
#
# Each VRID Section must begin with [VRID] keyword

# serverid is needed to specify the number of the VRID, here VRID = 1

# you must set interface with a real interface name of your system
# this interface is used for sending VRRP announces

# useVMAC option let you the possibility to use standard Virtual MAC adresses
# defined by RFC2338 or not. If set useVMAC = no, ethernet adresses of devices
# are never changed. you must specify sendgratuitousarp = yes in this case.
# the default option is yes
useVMAC = yes

# this option specify a timeout for an interface like bge/em go down and up
# when an ethernet (lladdr) adress is setted on it. em/bge take about 2/3
# secondes before becoming up and running after transiting MASTER/BACKUP states
# the default is 10 seconds and must work with all NICs without problems
carriertimeout = 10

# this option must be set for switches that have spanning tree activated
# because there is a time between the port activation and the first VLANs
# packets received. A value of 40 seconds will be good.
# by default, spanningtreelatency is disabled (=0)
spanningtreelatency = 0

# choose to send a gratuitous ARP packet or not. By default, freebsd must send
# a gratuitous ARP when the MAC is changed on a device. But you can specify
# to freevrrpd to send a gratuitous ARP for updating ARP tables on the network
# the default is no

# priority = 255 is a MASTER of the VRID

# addr option is need to specify ip address(es) associated with the VRID
# you can specify multiple addresses separated by ','
# netmask is specified with CIDR notation so number after '/' represent the
# number of bits set to 1 for the netmask.
# eg: /24 is 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 = 255.255.255.0
# you can specify another (pseudo-)device for setting this(ese) adress(es)

# if physical interface attached to VRID 1 fail you can specify one or more
# VRIDs that must go to backup state in the same time. (monitored circuits)
# in this example if rl0 is faulty, xl0 and bge0 go to backup state mode
# This is extremly useful to avoir blackhole with Firewalls with two interfaces

# if you want to authenticate your VRRP packets you can set a password
# associated with this VRID. this is not required but is you don't set a

# authentification. If you set this, you must set it to BACKUP VRID too, if you
# don't, all BACKUP VRRP packets will be rejected.

# if you want to authenticate your VRRP packets by AH encryption you must set
# this option to yes and specify a presharedkey parameter or useIKE=yes if you

# if you want to use an external key exchanger IKE, let freevrrpd know it with
# useIKE = yes

# if you have set AHencryption = yes and useIKE = no you must specify a pre
# shared key known by VRRP servers that is on the same VRID, you can specify
