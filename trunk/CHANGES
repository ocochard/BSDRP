Release 0.35

**** WARNING: Special upgrade procedure is needed for this release ! ****

- Update to FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE
- BSDRP's nanobsd patches were include to FreeBSD-current, then replace BSDRP's nanobsd by FreeBSD's nanobsd
- Reduce bootloader timeout to 1 second
- Reduce the security level of the kernel to default value (loading kernel module is easiest)
- Use xz in place of bzip2 for BSDRP files (images, mtree)
- Possibility to use a post-upgrade script included in the new image during upgrade
- Detect KVM guest usage
- MS Windows Virtualbox lab script improvement: Permit to use a 'shared with host (hostonly)' interface
- Added: net/mpd5, a PPP Multilink daemon (multilink, PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP and EAP authentication, PPTP, L2TP, PPPoE, etc...)
- Disable polling by default: Modern NIC include interrupt management and enabling polling on this modern NIC can reduce performance

Bug fixes:
- Hardened the upgrade and config scripts
- Add missing kernel modules and binary: ipfw_nat, libaliase, pflog, tap interface

Updated packages:
- freeVRRPd (It depends of some netgraph modules now)
- Quagga
- Bird
- tmux
- ssmtp

Know bugs:
- "system endpoint" seams to decrease TCP performance in place of increase them
- FreeBSD Bootloader manager (boot0) didn't support serial speed value more than 9600 baud (kernel and console use 38400)

*** Upgrade procedure ***
The new nanobsd script change the glabel name scheme of the partition, then the embedded upgrade script can't manage
theses new names.
You need to use a special upgrade script, that will convert partition name.

1. Download the special upgrade script to your router in /tmp
As example, using fetch:
cd /tmp
fetch http://bsdrp.net/tools/upgrade-to-035
chmod +x /tmp/upgrade-to-035
2. Launch the upgrade using this newly downloaded upgrade script
As example, from a SSH server:
ssh username@ssh-sever-name cat /directory-to/BSDRP_0.35_upgrade_i386_serial.img.xz | unxz | /tmp/upgrade-to-035
3. Once done, reboot and answer "no" to the question "Do you want to save your configuration?"
