Release 0.3 (not released)

- Upgrade to FreeBSD 8.0-BETA2 (and add FreeBSD 7.2 support)
- Add XORP (http://www.xorp.org/)
- Add ISISd with Quagga
- Enable IPv6 forwarding by default (it was a bug and not a feature)
- Enable carp,lagg,vlan,netgraph in the kernel
- Cleanup: Remove all non usefull kernel modules, remove perl, gzip kernel, replace vim with vim-lite
- Begin to tune kernel and sysctl values
- Enable device polling for all NIC that support it (and changes HZ from 1000 to 2000)
- Patch NanoBSD with a proposed patch (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=136889)

To do:
- Need to test XORP
- Removing all compilation tools (needed only during quagga, net-snmp, xorp and vim installation)
- Need to found a solution for reducing HZ (to 50) for correct performance under under Qemu,VirtualBox, VMware, etc. (Idea: copy the active part to the passive, add kern.hz in /boot/loader.conf, disable polling in rc.conf, and boot0cfg)
=> Need to add a warning message if Qemu/VMware/Virtualbox is detected meanwhile
- Need to check that ARCH is correctly used when compiling new port (see some amd64 message when compiling for i386 from an amd64 freebsd)
- Need to create an admin account to be used in place of root ?
- Need to remove the man pages installed by ports that don't respect the "NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES" rules
